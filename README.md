# Next-Project-Boilerplate

Boilerplate for starting `next` projects.

## Babel

There is no need for `babel-preset-env` as it is part of `next`; however because of the way `next` compiles in a _testing_ environment what is present in the `.babelrc` must be present or _no bueno_.

> Update config files as needed!
